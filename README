A virtual sequence is 1) a container for your sequences (say seq_rst and seq_pkt) each  with its own uvm_do instructions and 2) coordiator executor of seq_rst and seq_rst, serially or fork

A virtual sequencer is just a container for your sequencers  (say seqr_pkt) that were pre-created in agents; point to agent's sequencers
